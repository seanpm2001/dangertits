Hello I was wondering if you might have a contact address, I was trying to send you an email to say you have my attention. I like your goal of trying to follow everything. I saw this one account he called himself the MySpace tom of github, he was following like 300 thousand people and there are a few accounts mauybe following 20,000 I was trying to set a modest goal like 150 or 180 thousand.
