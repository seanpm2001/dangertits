Hello I was wondering if you might have a contact address, I was trying to send you an email to say you have my attention. I like your goal of trying to follow everyone. I saw this one account he called himself the MySpace tom of github, he was following like 300 thousand people and there are a few accounts following maybe 20,000 people. I was trying to set a modest goal of like 150 or 180 thousand.


here is the account I was talking about:

You can contact me via my email raxoimm@outlook.com . I have to slowly work through accounts due to school , and theres a limit of how many I can follow at a certain time , but many thanks for linking this account
